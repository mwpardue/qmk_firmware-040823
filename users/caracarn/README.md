Much credit is owed to the many folks out there more talented than I. I can never name them all but major credit goes to:

rafaelromao, whose work served as the foundation upon which I've built my userspace. All credit for anything innovative or 'neat' goes to him, unless otherwise noted. (https://github.com/rafaelromao/keyboards/tree/main/src/qmk/users/rafaelromao)
Pascal Getreuer, whose site has been hugely valuable in helping me to learn the ins and outs of QMK. I also owe him for features such as Caps_Word, Achordion, and I'm sure more to come. (https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/index.html)
